Project description: 
Our project is focused on designing a 3D food printer that can be used by people who seem to have very little time to cook for themselves. The product we are designing is supposed to promote a happier, healthier lifestyle for the consumers, and provide them with more time to complete their daily tasks. For our project, we are researching the cost of production, as well as the price the consumers will need to pay to buy this product. We are trying to minimize cost as much as possible while providing the consumers with the best experience possible. The team will be conducting a business pitch in the following month to showcase the research done and the overall idea for our first model.
